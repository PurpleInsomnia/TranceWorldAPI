        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 35px;">
        Trance World (as of writing this on April 9th 2025), is a solo project, made for PurpleInsomnia's high school senior project, and is planned to recieve many, many updates following the demo release.
        <br>
        Even though it's a free game... it'll still cost money to develop further, and make the game better for the people to play.
        <br>
        Donating to this project will help fund cool new music, artwork and many more from really talented people. Donating will also help PurpleInsomnia personally, letting him know that people fw this game and he should chug another redbull.
        <br>
        Any- and all donations are appreciated, here are the current goals/plans this game is aiming to reach:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">
        1. STEAM release - (Steam charges money for publishing, why not help out this game get more traction?)
        <br>
        2. GUEST COMPOSERS - (From niche to "oh!!! that guy!", I hope to make this soundtrack packed every update!)
        <br>
        3. COOL MERCH - (Plushies, shirts, CDs... Anything to rep your love!)
        </p>
